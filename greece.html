      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p> Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in <time datetime="1830">1830</time>. During the second half of the 19<sup>th</sup> century and the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, it gradually added neighboring islands and territories, most with Greek-speaking populations. </p>
        <p>In World War II, Greece was first invaded by Italy (<time datetime="1940">1940</time>) and subsequently occupied by Germany (<time datetime="1941">1941</time>-<time datetime="1944">44</time>); fighting endured in a protracted civil war between supporters of the king and other anti-communist and communist rebels.</p>
        <p>Following the latter's defeat in <time datetime="1949">1949</time>, Greece joined <abbr title="The North Atlantic Treaty Organization"> NATO</abbr> in <time datetime="1952">1952</time>. In <time datetime="1967">1967</time>, a group of military officers seized power, establishing a military dictatorship that suspended many political liberties and forced the king to flee the country.</p>
        <p>In <time datetime="1974">1974</time> following the collapse of the dictatorship, democratic elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and abolished the monarchy. In <time datetime="1981">1981</time>, Greece joined the <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> (now the <abbr title="European Union"> EU</abbr>); it became the 12<sup>th</sup> member of the European Economic and Monetary Union in <time datetime="2001">2001</time>.</p>
        <p>Greece has suffered a severe economic crisis since late <time datetime="2009">2009</time>, due to nearly a decade of chronic overspending and structural rigidities. Beginning in <time datetime="2010">2010</time>, Greece entered three bailout agreements - the first two with the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the <abbr title="International Monetary Fund">IMF</abbr>; and the third in <time datetime="2015">2015</time> with the European Stability Mechanism - worth in total about $300 billion.</p>
        <p>The Greek Government formally exited the third bailout in <time datetime="2018-08">August 2018</time>.</p>

         <h3>Telecommunication systems</h3>
         <h4>General assessment</h4>
         <p>Greece’s telecom market is susceptible to the country’s volatile economy, and as a result revenue among the key networks has been variable.</p>
         <p>Broadband subscriptions in Greece are developing steadily despite the difficult economic conditions.</p>
         <p>The main networks are concentrating investment on fiber-based next generation networks, enabling them to reach the European broadband targets for <time datetime="2025">2025</time>.</p>
         <p>Their work is also supported by government ultra-fast broadband projects, largely funded by the <abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr> and aimed at delivering a service of at least 100<abbr title="Megabyte per second">Mb/s</abbr> to under served areas.</p>
         <p>After extensive trials of <abbr title="Fifth Generation">5G</abbr>, the <abbr title="Mobile Network Operator">MNOs</abbr> were able to launch commercial services in early <time datetime="2021">2021</time> following the <time datetime="2020-12">December 2020</time> allocation of frequencies in a range of bands.</p>
         <h4>Domestic</h4>
         <ul>
           <li>Microwave radio relay trunk system</li>
           <li>Extensive open-wire connections</li>
           <li>Submarine cable to offshore islands</li>
           <li>Nearly 46 per 100 subscribers for fixed-line and 110 per 100 for mobile-cellular (<time datetime="2020">2020</time>).</li>
         </ul>
         <h4>International</h4>
         <p>The country code is 30.</p>
         <p>Landing points for the <abbr title="South-East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 3">SEA-ME-WE-3</abbr>, Adria-1, Italy-Greece 1, OTEGLOBE, MedNautilus Submarine System, Aphrodite 2, AA3-1 and Silphium optical telecommunications submarine cable that provides links to Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia, Asia and Australia.</p>
         <p>There is a tropospheric scatter.</p>
         <p>Greece is connected to serveral satellite earth stations:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>2 Intelsat (1 Atlantic Ocean and 1 Indian Ocean)</li>
           <li>1 Eutelsat</li>

         <h5><small>Notes</small></h5>
         <p><small>The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on production and supply chains globally. Since <time datetime="2020">2020</time>, some aspects of the telecom sector have experienced a downturn, particularly in mobile device production.</small></p>
         <p><small>Progress towards 5G implementation has resumed, as well as upgrades to infrastructure. Consumer spending on telecom services has increased due to the surge in demand for capacity and bandwidth.</small></p>
         <p><small>The crucial nature of telecom services as a tool for work and school from home is still evident, and the spike in this area has seen growth opportunities for development of new tools and increased services.</small></p>
