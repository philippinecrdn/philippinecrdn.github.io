      <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <p>Stockholm is the capital of Sweden.</p>
        <p>It is a city near water with a completely different architecture than Paris' or London's.</p>
        <p>It is a kingdom, thus a lot of history is related to kings and queens.</p>
        <p>Sweden is the country of Abba.
        <p>And for all the fans out there, there is a museum dedicated to them in Stockholm.</p>
        <p>Finally, a lot of Swedish talk English which makes Stockholm more accessible to tourists compared to other cities/countries in Eastern and Northern Europe.</p>

        <h2>My opinion</h2>
          <p>I have been to Stockholm with my parents as our annual trip.</p>
          <p>The first thing that I noticed is the inclination and the depth of the escalators.</p>
          <p>The city is well serviced by the metrorail.</p>
          <p>I really recommend going to the Skansen zoo where it is possible to observe typical houses and bears and elks (the Europe version of the moose).</p>
          <p>There is also a museum in which the main attraction is an old boat: the Vasa Museum.</p>
          <p>We went there in April which allowed us to see gardens in Spring and it was beautiful.</p>
          <p>The architecture can be very colorful with a lot of red which brings a lot of brightness to the city.</p>
          <p>I also recommend going to the Drottingholm palace.</p>
          <p>It is accessible by boat and both the palace and the journey are worth it.</p>
