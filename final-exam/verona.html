      <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <p>Verona is a small italian city not far from Milan and Venice.</p>
        <p>While it is an old city, it doesn't have a major history.</p>
        <p>However, it is very charming and has historic buildings such as a theather and a castle.</p>
        <p>It was built near a river which add a lot of charm to the city.</p>
        <p>Finally, it is where Romeo and Juliet are from.</p>

        <h2>My opinion</h2>
          <p>I have been there for an exchange.</p>
          <p>I had been learning Italien for 3 years and my teacher had a contact in an high school in Verona.</p>
          <p>They organized an exchange.</p>
          <p>So an Italian girl came live with me in Paris for two weeks and then I went there for two weeks.</p>
          <p>It was such a fun experience.</p>
          <p>I was going to the same high school as her, I was following the same classes.</p>
          <p>The school system in Italy is different from the French one which made the experience even more interesting.</p>
          <p>I was spending most of my afternoons visiting with another French girl.</p>
          <p>Verona is everything you can expect from a small Italian city.</p>
          <p>There were not a lot of tourists as we went there in October.</p>
          <p>The streets are beautiful and the churches are astonishing.</p>
          <p>We were there during the Biennale Arte di Venezia which is a major art event, thus the Italian teacher brought us to Venice.</p>
          <p>Venice is pretty but not very convenient to visit as there are too many tourists and the streets are very narrow.</p>
          <p>I really recommend visiting Verona in a context of road trip in Northern Italy.</p>
