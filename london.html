      <h2>Presentation</h2>
        <p>London is the capital of the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p>It is a city full of history which makes it particularly attractive to me.</p>
        <p>London is also a capital with international outreach thanks to its economic power.</p>
        <p>Its architecture is specific to the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> and makes it easily recognizable.</p>
        <p>Finally, it is the kingdom's center as it welcomes Buckingham Palace.</p>

        <h2>My opinion</h2>
          <p>I have been to London twice.</p>
          <p>The first time was with my parents.</p>
          <p>It was my first real trip.</p>
          <p>We had been to Sardegna the year before but we didn't visit like we did in London and how we kept doing after that.</p>
          <p>Going to London from Paris is pretty easy, we only have to take a train.</p>
          <p>The second time I was just passing by and spent a night in Greenwhich.</p>
          <p>It is such a wonderful city!</p>
          <p>Parks are beautiful, there are squirrels and swans everywhere.</p>
          <p>It is possible to encounter places with historic value everywhere.</p>
          <p>Public transports are well developed and easy to use.</p>
          <p>Museums are incredible.</p>
          <p>There are so many things to discover that I would love to go back again.</p>
          <p>I am pretty sure I have only seen a quarter of what the city has to offer.</p>
