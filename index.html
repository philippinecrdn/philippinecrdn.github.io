      <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As a French person, I feel like I have the responsibility to teach foreigners about Europe.</p>
        <p>I have noticed since I am in Miami, that many Americans know little about this continent.</p>
        <p>In the first weeks of my arrival to the United States, I was asked if France was in Europe.</p>
        <p>Of course, I was surprised by this question.</p>
        <p>It is regularly shown on social media that Americans are not the most educated about Europe.</p>
        <p>But I never thought it was actually true.</p>
        <p>That is why I decided to create this webpage.</p>

      <h2>What is Europe?</h2>
        <article>
          <h3>Composition</h3>
          <p>Europe is a continent that is separated from the Americas by the Atlantic ocean.</p>
          <p>It is composed of 50 countries.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Europe has been a major component of global trade before the United States were created.</p>
            <p>It has also been the land of major empires such as the Roman empire, to name one of the oldest, but also the French empite, the British Empire and the third Reich.</p>
            <p>These empires were built because of colonisations.</p>
            <p>Thus, it led to many wars and other conflicts between European countries but also between them and other countries from other continents.</p>
            <p>The Third Reich is the one that caused World War II.</p>
            <p>It was ruled by Adolph Hitler and was at the origin of the genocides of the Holocaust and of the Gyspy Genocide.</p>
            <p>The end of World War II created a need for European countries to feel closer to each other and to take advantage of the continent resources.</p>
            <p>This is among other motivations, what led to the creation of the European Union.</p>

          <h3>The European Union (<abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>)</h3>
            <p>Although the EU is not a federation in the strict sense, it is far more than a free-trade association such as <abbr title="Association of Southeast Asian Nations">ASEAN</abbr> or <abbr title="Southern Common Market">Mercosur</abbr>, and it has certain attributes associated with independent nations: its own flag, currency (for some members), and law-making abilities, as well as diplomatic representation and a common foreign and security policy in its dealings with external partners.</p>
            <p>In <time datetime="1950">1950</time>, the French Foreign Minister Robert SCHUMAN proposed pooling the production of coal and steel in Western Europe and setting up an organization for that purpose that would bring France and the Federal Republic of Germany together and would be open to other countries as well.</p>
            <p>The following year, the European Coal and Steel Community (<abbr title="European Coal and Steel Community">ECSC</abbr>) was set up when six members - Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands - signed the Treaty of Paris.</p>
            <p>In <time datetime="1957">1957</time>, envisioning an "ever closer union," the Treaties of Rome were signed creating the European Economic Community (<abbr title="European Economic Community">EEC</abbr>) and the European Atomic Energy Community (<abbr title="European Atomic Energy Community">Euratom</abbr>), and the six member states strove to eliminate trade barriers among themselves by forming a common market.</p>
            <p>In <time datetime="1967">1967</time>, the institutions of all three communities were formally merged into the European Community (<abbr title="European Community">EC</abbr>), creating a single Commission, a single Council of Ministers, and the body known today as the European Parliament.</p>
            <p>In <time datetime="1973">1973</time>, the first enlargement of the EC took place with the addition of Denmark, Ireland, and the UK.</p>
            <p>The <time datetime="1980">1980</time>s saw further membership expansion with Greece joining in <time datetime="1981">1981</time> and Spain and Portugal in <time datetime="1986">1986</time>.</p>
            <p>The <time datetime="1992">1992</time> Treaty of Maastricht laid the basis for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy, in judicial and internal affairs, and in the creation of an economic and monetary union - including a common currency.</p>
            <p>This further integration created the European Union (EU), at the time standing alongside the EC.</p>
            <p>In <time datetime="1995">1995</time>, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined the EU/EC, raising the total number of member states to 15.</p>
            <p>A new currency, the euro, was launched in world money markets on <time datetime="1999-01-01">1 January 1999</time>; it became the unit of exchange for all EU member states except Denmark, Sweden, and the <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>.</p>
            <p>Ten new countries joined the EU in <time datetime="2004">2004</time> - Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Bulgaria and Romania joined in <time datetime="2007">2007</time> and Croatia in <time datetime="2013">2013</time>, but the UK withdrew in <time datetime="2020">2020</time>.</p>
            <p>Current membership stands at 27.</p>

      <h2>Tips to travel more sustainably</h2>
        <h3>Farther is not better</h3>
          <p>Your country may have to much to offer that most of the time you don't really need to go across oceans to see something incredible.</p>
        <h3>The longer the better</h3>
          <p>Taking a six-hour flight just to stay 3 nights in a city is not really beneficial to the environment.</p>
        <h3>Consider the train rather than the plane</h3>
          <p>While taking a train in the USA can feel a little bit like a loss of time, in Europe it is pretty easy to take the train to go to Italy or Spain from France for example.</p>
          <p>It is even possible to go from Belgium or France to England by train with the undersea train.</p>
        <h3>Adopt the local life</h3>
          <p>It is most of the time more enlightening to stay at a Bed and Breakfast or at a hostel rather than a Hilton resort.</p>
          <p>Mainly because you contribute to the local economy and may discover more unique places compared to touristic places recommanded by every big Hotel of the city.</p>
