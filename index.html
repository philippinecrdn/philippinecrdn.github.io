   <h2>Who am I?</h2>
   <p>Hello! I am Philippine a 19-year-old girl coming from Paris, France. I am staying in Miami for four months, the whole fall semester 2022.</p>
   <p>In France I study Economics and English, which includes:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>British and American History</li>
     <li>British and American Literature in relation to Economics</li>
     <li>Phonetics</li>
     <li>Accounting</li>
     <li>Media and New Media</li>
    </ul>
   <p>My top three favorite classes are:</p>
   <ol>
     <li>Media and New Media</li>
     <li>Introduction to communication professions</li>
     <li>British History</li>
    </ol>
   <h2>Why am I here?</h2>
   <p>Here is a fun fact: I never wanted to come to Miami. It has never been in my plan. I wanted to go to New-York. It was and still is, my dream.</p>
   <p>When I applied to study abroad I never checked Miami, not even once. So imagine my reaction when I was announced I was coming here. Well you can't really imagine so here is a description:</p>
   <p>I was sitting first row in my American History class when I received an email notification "MICEFA Placement and Application Information".</p>
   <p>Of course I was not expecting to receive an answer on that day, February 1st 2022. So I jumped on my notification, only to realize I was not going to my dream city nor to California but to Miami.</p>
   <p>I stared my screen for several minutes not knowing what to do because of course I was still supposed to be focus on my class so I couldn't really expressed my feelings.</p>
   <p>My first thought was: "What I am going to do in Miami? It is absolutely not a city that was made for me". I live in Paris and I fit the French clich√© on several points:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I love museums</li>
      <li>I love French food (such as croissants of course)</li>
      <li>I am always in a hurry, I need to walk fast</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Plus, I don't like hot temperature, I prefer winter (maybe it's because I was born in December). I don't especially like to go to the beach, I don't have my driver's licence and I hate partying (I went to a club once in Italy, I am never going agains). Miami was far from being the right fit.</p>
    <p>But against all odds, I accepted the offer (well, I didn't have much choice) and here I am.</p>

      <td>Brickell</td>
      <td>I loved the Brickell Center and the building. It is close from water.</td>
      <td>Nothing to visit and it is small. You easily cross the border between the active center and the more residential streets.</td>
      <td>3/5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Coconut Grove</td>
      <td>It was very pleasing. There many trees and shops. I loved the bookshop.</td>
      <td>It is not very accessible unless you have a car. We had to walk 25min from the metro station to the center of the neighborhood.</td>
      <td>3.5/5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bill Baggs State Park</td>
      <td>The lighthouse is a wonderful point of view to observe the whole park and the ocean.</td>
      <td>If UM hadn't offered to take us there I would have never been because it is not accessible. The beach was small, we didn't have much room to lay on the sand.</td>
      <td>2.75/5</td>
